I'm Adam Jahnke-I've been working on the web for 15 years now, and I enjoy it
more and more all the time. I have experience all over the stack (Ruby and
Rails included), but my main focus has been JavaScript. I also _absolutely
love_ working on command line tools and automation; I feel at home on the
command line.

I love what Basecamp stands for as a company. I have a family and we have been
witness to the industry's tendency to push the limits by asking for too much. I
believe in a more human and healthy work environment, and I also believe that
it takes effort from employees _and_ employers to achieve it. I'm so glad to
hear the stance Basecamp has publicly taken on this, but I'd love to hear from
_you, the people of Basecamp_ how real it is, and how it has effected your
lives.

Thank you for your consideration,  
Adam Jahnke
