Hey, I'm Adam Jahnke - I've been working in software since
2006, and I love it.

I appreciate what Basecamp stands for as a company; I have a family and we have
been witness to the industry's tendency to push the limits by asking for too
much. I believe a more humane and healthy work environment is possible, and I
believe that it takes effort from both employees and employers to achieve it.
I'm glad to hear the stance that Basecamp has publicly taken on this.

I'm not concerned with trying to participate in the next big network or viral
product. I just want to create tools that help make people's lives better. That
feels meaningful and worthwhile to me. I want to use my skills to help people
and I don't want to kill myself doing it. In reading through the employee
handbook, I was struck by how _we value the same things_. That's why I'm
applying for this job, and why I think I could work well here.

I have experience in many web-centric technologies, Ruby and Rails included.
Very recently I've been focused in JavaScript, specifically Electron and
Node.js. I'd really like to get back to the "Golden Age of Web Development". I
love working on command line tools and automation; I feel at home on the
command line. I think my technical skill, experience, and flexibility makes me
a good candidate for this position. I've detailed which areas and technologies
I'm familiar with in my résumé. I would love to talk further about my past
experiences and specific strengths.

I've worked remotely for the last 12 years, so I'm familiar with the home/life
balance required, I'm used to self-guided work, and I am practiced at
navigating when to ask for backup and when to be ready to go learn whatever is
necessary to accomplish the work at hand.

I have been very fortunate to be guided in mentorship by several people with
whom I keep in contact for career and technical advice. That has given me a
great appreciation for mentorships and I devote time to mentoring beginner
programmers. I don't have a CS degree, so this type of learning and career
development is very close to my heart. I put serious effort into working with
people smarter than I am and cultivating a team culture of mutual learning. I
believe that people should be the most important part of any corporate effort,
internally and externally.

Thank you for your consideration,  
Adam Jahnke
