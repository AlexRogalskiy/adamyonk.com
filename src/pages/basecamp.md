I'm Adam Jahnke-I've been working on the web for 15 years now, and I enjoy it
more and more all the time. I have experience all over the stack (Ruby and
Rails included), but my main focus has been JavaScript, in the browser and
Node.js. I _absolutely love_ working on command line tools and automation; I
feel at home on the command line. I think my technical skill and experience
makes me a good candidate for this position, but I want to be sure that I would
be a good fit here.

I love what Basecamp stands for as a company; I have a family and we have been
witness to the industry's tendency to push the limits by asking for too much. I
believe in a more human and healthy work environment, and I believe that it
takes effort from both employees _and_ employers to achieve it. I'm so glad to
hear the stance Basecamp has publicly taken on this, but I'd love to hear from
_you_ how real it is, and how it has effected your life.

I have been fascinated with computers since junior high when I started learning
about programming. I have been very fortunate to be guided in mentorship by
several people whom I continue to seek out for career and technical advice. I
have a soft spot for mentorships and I have started devoting time to mentoring
beginner programmers in recent years.

Unfortunately, most of the code I've been responsible for in my career is
proprietary information, but I've detailed which areas and technologies I'm
familiar with in my résumé. I would love to talk you further about my
experiences and specific strengths. I try to help where I can in open-source
projects, but I would be excited to work on a team that regularly writes open
code!

In reading through the employee handbook, I was struck by how we _value the
same things_. That's why I'm applying for this job, and why I think I could
work well here.

Thank you for your consideration,  
Adam Jahnke
