I'm Adam Jahnke-I've been working on the web for 15 years now, and I enjoy it
more and more all the time. I have experience all over the stack (Ruby and
Rails included), but my main focus has been JavaScript, in the browser and
Node.js. I also _absolutely love_ working on command line tools and automation;
I feel at home on the command line. I think my technical skill and experience
makes me a good candidate for this position, but I want to be sure that I would
be a good fit here.

I love what Basecamp stands for as a company. I have a family and we have been
witness to the industry's tendency to push the limits by asking for too much. I
believe in a more human and healthy work environment, and I also believe that
it takes effort from employees _and_ employers to achieve it. I'm so glad to
hear the stance Basecamp has publicly taken on this, but I'd love to hear from
_you_ how real it is, and how it has effected your life.

I don't have a degree, but I also wouldn't be so proud as to say that I'm
"self-taught"; perhaps "self-motivated", though. I have been fascinated with
computers since junior high, when I started learning about web development.  I
have been very fortunate to be guided in metorship by several people that I
continue to seek out for career and technical advice. I have a soft spot for
mentorships and I have started trying to devote time to mentoring beginner
programmers in recent years.

Unfortunately most of the code I've been responsible for in my career is
protected, proprietary information, but I've attempted to detail what areas and
technologies I'm familiar with in my résumé, and I would love to talk about my
experiences and specific strengths. I try to help where I can in open-source
projects, but I would be so excited to work on a team that regularly writes
open code!

Thank you for your consideration,  
Adam Jahnke
