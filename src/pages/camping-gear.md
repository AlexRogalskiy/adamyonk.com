This is a list of camping gear that I like.

## Packs

- His: [Osprey Atmos 65 AG](https://amzn.com/B00MN17Y3A)
- Hers: [Osprey Aura 50 AG](https://amzn.com/B00PZKX2X2)

## Sleeping Bags/Pads

- His: [REI Radiant Sleeping Bag](https://www.rei.com/product/862474/rei-radiant-sleeping-bag)
- Hers: [REI Serrana Sleeping Bag](https://www.rei.com/product/862476/rei-serrana-sleeping-bag-womens)
- Kids: [REI Radiant 20](https://www.rei.com/product/129831)
- Single Pad: [Therm-a-Rest NeoAir All Season Mattress](https://amzn.com/B00G4V2AV6)
- Double Pad: [Klymit Double V Two Person Sleeping Pad](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N28PUYX/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_iQKyCbTB204G2)

## Tent

- [Mountain Hardwear Optic 2.5 Tent](https://www.rei.com/product/864138/mountain-hardwear-optic-25-tent)
- [REI Kingdom 6 Tent 2018](https://www.rei.com/product/894016/rei-co-op-kingdom-6-tent-2018)
  _ [REI Kingdom Garage 2018](https://www.rei.com/product/894018/rei-co-op-kingdom-garage-2018)
  _ [REI Kingdom 6 Footprint 2018](https://www.rei.com/product/827808)

## Chairs

- [Helinox Camp Chair](https://www.bigagnes.com/Products/Detail/Helinox/helinoxcampchair2016)
- [Helinox Sunset Chair](https://www.bigagnes.com/Products/Detail/Helinox/helinoxsunsetchair2016)

Definitely a luxury for camping, but I got a couple of the camp chairs and they're quite comfortable and portable. In hindsight, I'd probably get the Sunset chair as it has more of a headrest and is only 0.3lb heavier and a little over 1 inch longer (packed).

## Stove

- [MSR PocketRocket](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5O7551/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_wR9GDbVR2FJD5)

<!--
* [MSR Universal Canister Stand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00453UJMM/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1)
* [Small Propane Tank/Lindal Valve Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072QXKVJP/ref=ox_sc_act_title_4?smid=A1WHZ6YO81GOCU&psc=1)

* [Kovea Supalite Titanium Stove](https://amzn.com/B003EYTFE6)
* [Kovea LPG Adaptor](https://amzn.com/B00CFPISZW)

I got the MSR basically as a backup in case we couldn't get a fire going. It's really small and simple, but if I was buying again, I'd get the Kovea with the LPG adapter so I could use those green Coleman propane bottles in a pinch - they're more prevalent than the 'backpacking' propane canisters (the smaller, usually red/orange colored bottles). I haven't looked into it enough to know if you can use the LPG adapter on any camp stove, or if the stove needs to be built
differently to use the green Coleman bottles.

## Cookware

- [Snow Peak Titanium Multi Compact Cookset](https://amzn.com/B0006OQC0M)
- [Snow Peak Trek 700](https://amzn.com/B000AR2N7Q)

## Boots

- His: [KEEN Targhee II Mid](https://amzn.com/B00RM22F84)
- Hers: [KEEN Targhee II Mid](https://amzn.com/B00ZG2T29W)
- Socks: [Smartwool PhD](https://amzn.com/B007P214YW)

These boots are so comfortable and there was really no 'break in' time. I haven't had them for very long, but in the reviews I read, they seem to be very durable and well-made.

## Knife

- Multi-tool: [Leatherman Wave](https://amzn.com/B0002H49BC)

## Water Filtration

- Single: [Sawyer Mini](https://amzn.com/B00MPH1M80)
- Basecamp (4+): [Platypus GravityWorks 4L](https://amzn.com/B00G4V4IVQ)
- For 'tea'-like water: [MSR SweetWater](https://amzn.com/B001BNPJK6)

I haven't actually purchased or used the MSR, but since it's ceramic, I hear that it's easier to keep unclogged and clean in more 'tea'-colored water with a lot of vegetation decay. I have used the Platypus with a camp of 6 and it worked quite well. The nice thing about the Sawyer is that you can hook it up inline with a hydration pack. It's basically the same concept as the Platypus, so if you're just going solo or with another camper, it's probably easier and cheaper to just get a couple of the Sawyers.

## Lighting

- Lantern: [Black Diamond Voyager](https://amzn.com/B00N3IAXXU)
- Headlamp: [Black Diamond Spot](https://amzn.com/B00FYK1PIC)

## Misc

I took a hatchet along for wood-preparation, but I got some advice from a friend that I'm going to try instead next time: Take a good knife (like the one on the Leatherman) and a lightweight, folding camp saw. You can cut larger things with the saw, and split smaller logs by using a large rock or branch to knock on the back of your knife.
