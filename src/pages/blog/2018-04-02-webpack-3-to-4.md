I recently moved a large project from webpack 3 to 4, and the documentation is very light<a name="1-ref"></a><sup>[1](#1)</sup>. I just wanted to throw together a few notes about the bumps in the road here. For more info about the release check out:

* The [webpack 4 announcement post](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-4-released-today-6cdb994702d4) on Medium
* The [v4.0.0 tag release notes](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v4.0.0) on GitHub

## Upgrade node to 8.9.4

To get the best performance out of v4, [@wSokra says](https://twitter.com/wSokra/status/967852475918274561) use node 8.9.4.

## Upgrade webpack

```bash
yarn add webpack webpack-cli --dev
```

## Use a mode

`The 'mode' option has not been set. Set 'mode' option to 'development' or 'production' to enable defaults for this environment.`

You have to choose a mode:

```javascript
mode: "production",
```

## Get rid of webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin

`Error: webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin has been removed, please use config.optimization.splitChunks instead.`

We used `runtime` and `vendor` chunks in v3 like so:

```javascript
plugins: [
  …
  new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({
    name: ["runtime"],
    minChunks: Infinity,
  }),
  new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({
    name: "vendor",
    minChunks: ({ resource }) => /node_modules/.test(resource),
  }),
  …
]
```

In v4, this roughly translates to:

```javascript
optimization: {
  runtimeChunk: "single", // enable "runtime" chunk
  splitChunks: {
    cacheGroups: {
      vendor: {
        test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
        name: "vendor",
        chunks: "all",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

More info about the new `optimization.splitChunks` option can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/sokra/1522d586b8e5c0f5072d7565c2bee693).

## Get rid of webpack.optimize.ModuleConcatenationPlugin

It is now on by default in `production` mode.

## Change webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin

`Error: webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin has been removed, please use config.optimization.minimize instead.`

v4 now handles dead code elimination internally. Both it and minimization are on by default in `production` mode, but to continue tuning Uglify settings, add [uglifyjs-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglifyjs-webpack-plugin):

```bash
yarn add -D uglifyjs-webpack-plugin
```

And in the `optimization.minimizer` section:

```javascript
const UglifyJsPlugin = require("uglifyjs-webpack-plugin");
…
optimization: {
  minimizer: [
    new UglifyJSPlugin(...)
  ]
},
```

## Upgrade eslint-loader

`Module build failed: TypeError: Cannot read property 'eslint' of undefined`

```bash
yarn add eslint-loader --dev
```

## Upgrade file-loader

`Module build failed: TypeError: Cannot read property 'fileLoader' of undefined`

```bash
yarn add file-loader --dev
```
