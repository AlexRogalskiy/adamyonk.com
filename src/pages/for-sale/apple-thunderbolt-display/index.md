Apple Thunderbolt Display in original packaging.

There's one dead pixel in the right-center part of the screen. Hard to notice
unless you're looking for it.

I have the MagSafe 2 adaptor, so it works with new and old MacBooks, but I've
been having some issues with it where it will power my MacBook, but not charge
it. Not sure if it's the MacBook or the Display, but feel free to bring your
MacBook by to try it out before buying. It doesn't effect the functionality of
the display besides needing to use the power cord that came with your laptop.
