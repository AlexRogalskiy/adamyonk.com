I'm Adam Jahnke–I love what InVision is creating and I would like to start a conversation about joining the team.

I'm currently working at SolarWinds on the AppOptics product. I've worked on this team for over four years, through two acquisitions. There are some very talented people here and I've learned a lot, but I'm ready for some new challenges.

I've been working on the web for over ten years now, and I enjoy it more and more all the time. I have experience all over the stack, but recently I've been handling architectural decisions and research and development for front-end applications. I also _absolutely love_ working on command line tools and automation; I feel at home with Bash and Vim. On my current team I'm mostly responsible for our front-end code and build process, but I often fight for time to create things like setup scripts to help with onboarding new developers and command line tools to streamline developer facing processes.

I believe that developer happiness and streamlining team process are essential to the sustainability of a product and the culture around it. I'm also a devout believer in forming real procedure around front-end tooling and development. It takes a lot of effort to keep up with best practices in an area of development that evolves so quickly, but I enjoy the challenge. I think this is essential for larger teams working in newer front-end tech like Webpack, React, and Redux. I've made a role for myself at my current company that is devoted to pursuing this.

I'm also very passionate about design. My first job was at a design agency where I worked closely with the lead designer translating their .psd and .ai files into HTML and CSS. That process and the intricacies of the designer/developer relationship are familiar and quite enjoyable to me.

I would love to talk! Here is my [résumé](https://adamyonk.com/resume).

Thank you for your consideration,  
Adam Jahnke
